# 3D printed parts

---
Some of the parts in the module are 3D printed.
Printing settings:

- PLA is good enough
- around 5 walls, for strength
- infill around 50%, also for strength
- supports: not required for most parts

As a side notr, we printed the whole set of gears, forks and plates and it mostly works. Of course we don't recomend using it in the competiton, however it was a great resource for the programming team while we were waiting for the machined parts.
